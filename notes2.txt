example searches with 0, 1, or many results (at time of writing!)

todo: if result is quarantined, does the json result show more info than regular page search result?



note that some links redirect, differently depending on location or user agent.
eg bbc.co.uk redirects to bbc.com when testing from netherlands VPN, and reddit search doesn't take this into account - different results for each.




initial implementation based on 
https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/annotate-page

reddit search docs
https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search
note
max q length 512 chars shorter than max url length, though likely won't matter in practice (urls typically much shorter)
limit useful for reducing size of response if just want to know whether has results or not (limit=1 sufficient)

useful links
https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/

current way getting url of current page maybe not ideal ( tabs permission )
maybe better to have a content script to read window.location

sidebar or button?
if JUST reddit results, just show a button with bit of text showing results (eg 0, 1, 2 ... n+ )


example of curling search api

regular search
curl https://www.reddit.com/search?q=test > resp1.txt

JSON "search" - note user agent maybe unnecessary
curl -A "com.filbs111.sidechannel" https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=test

limit number of results - note quotes to avoid escaping &
curl -A "com.filbs111.sidechannel" "https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=test&limit=1"

this gets a relatively small response (~10k - depends on the post), but still a lot of info don't need.
